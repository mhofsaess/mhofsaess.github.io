# We're a spinoff from the University of Stuttgart

The idea for enviConnect came when we were all working together at the Chair of Wind Energy at the University of Stuttgart.

We saw how much research never made it out of the labs, so we set up enviConnect to bring the best wind energy R&D to our customers.




In March 2023 we were awarded an EXIST Business Start-up Grant from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection to develop a new wind lidar management tool.
